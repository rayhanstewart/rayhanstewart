### ðŸ¤” Who?
I am a CS student currently enrolled at HCC planning to transfer out next year!
Hoping to work on some cool projects, let me know if you'd ever like to work together! My email is always open - __rayhan.stewart@howardcc.edu__

### ðŸ¤¯ What?
Oh also, I don't update this page nearly enough, though current projects include a website for the physics calculator and a project tracker app!
